# About DotNetNuke.R7

*DotNetNuke.R7* is a .NET library for DNN Platform extension development, which features:

- ASP.NET, DNN and Telerik webcontrol extension methods and *hacks*.
- Generic PetaPOCO-based controller base class which may serve as almost complete DAL.
- Base class to organize typed module / tabmodule settings access (no reflection for now).
- Useful string manipulation methods, most of them are String class extensions.
- Additional libraries containing features what can be used without DNN Platform
in any .NET / Mono (R7.Common) or ASP.NET (System.Web.R7) projects.

*DotNetNuke.R7* project's pragmatic goal is to make a library, which could be shared 
by all existing *R7.Solutions* modules, and also new ones via [R7.DnnTemplates](https://github.com/roman-yagodin/R7.DnnTemplates) integration.
